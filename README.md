## Step 1 - Retrieve weather Data

By generating a random list of 2000 Latitude and Longitudes , we retrieve the current weather from each city.

## Step 2 - Retrieve weather Data

Prompt a user to enter a min / max temperature , we wil filter the list to identify possible travel destinations and ultimately retrieve nearby hotels. From this data weill show these destination on an map with pop-up markers.

## Step 3 - Map the route between the selected destinations

Based on the data obtained in steps 1 and 2 , we will create a map that shows the travel route between the four cities and a map that shows pop up of all 4 cities on the route.
